A massive index of registry keys (Run keys, UserAssist, ShellBags) and file system locations (Prefetch, ShimCache, Amcache).

* Master Table: A single page mapping User Activity (e.g., "Opened a folder," "Ran a program") to the specific Forensic Artifact (ShellBags, Prefetch, ShimCache).
* Registry Hive Map: Key paths for persistence, recently used files (MRU), and hardware connections (USBSTOR).
