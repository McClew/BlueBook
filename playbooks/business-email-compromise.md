# Business Email Compromise

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a form of phishing attack where a theat actor impesonates colleagues, executives, suppliers or trusted partners via email into transfering funds or revealing sensitive data. BEC often involves convincing emails sent via spoofed email address or compromised accounts to bypass security filters.

Unlike standard phishing emails that are sent out indiscriminately to large numbers of email address, BEC attacks are usually cradted to specific individuals and can be harder to detect.

## Preparation

### User Awareness Training

Control Type: Administrative & Preventative

Conduct regular User Awarness Training to teach employees what to look for, guarding against emails that slip through email security filters.

### Phishing Simulations

Control Type: Administrative & Preventative

Alongside User Awarness Training, Phishing Simulations enable us to ensure that what employees are learning can be put into praxis and provides quantitive data to measure how well employees are performing in this preventative measure.

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Control Type: Technical & Preventative

Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email accounts, this ensures that if user credentials are leaked, that the threat actor cannot immediately take advantage.

### Logging

Control Type: Technical & Detective

Ensure audit logging (e.g., Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Log) is enabled and retained for at least 90 days.
